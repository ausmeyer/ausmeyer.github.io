I am a hospitalist physician with Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an Instructor at Harvard Medical School. I conduct research through the Harvard School of Public Health with Professor Mauricio Santillana where I develop statistical models to forecast cases in viral outbreaks.

Prior to that, I was a clinical fellow in a combined program for both adult and pediatric Infectious Diseases between Boston Children's Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. However, I left early for personal reasons; both programs are amazing and I could not recommend them more highly for anyone interested in pursuing training in adult and/or pediatric infectious diseases. I finished residency in the combined program in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics at the Ohio State University and Nationwide Children's Hospital. My graduate and post doctoral research focused on understanding and predicting the evolution of viral proteins, on protein molecular evolution, and on protein structural biology.

Broadly, I am interested in data science, inpatient medicine, infectious diseases, evolution, epidemiology and health informatics; I enjoy the process of applying mathematical modeling and statistical learning to diverse problems.

I also love learning and teaching biostatistics and data science. I like finding places where existing data or methods can be applied to ambiguous clinical reasoning. I also like exploring data visualization, using new presentation tools, and developing web applications to make information more useful to non-experts.

Although I was an experimental biologist in the past, these days my work is entirely computational/data analytical. Please no more advertisements offering to make antibodies.

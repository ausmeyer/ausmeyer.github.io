During 2017-2018, I will be a first year resident physician in the combined program in internal medicine and pediatrics at the Ohio State University and Nationwide Children's Hospital. 
<br>
My graduate and post doctoral research focused on understanding and predicting the evolution of viral proteins, on protein molecular evolution, and on protein structural biology. However, I enjoy the process of applying quantitative information to solve outstanding research problems in many fields. In addition, I love teaching biostatistics and computational statistics, and finding places where existing data or methods can be applied to adjust traditionally fuzzy clinical reasoning. I also like using new presentation tools and developing web applications to convey my message and make the information more useful to non-experts.
<br>
Although I was an experimental biologist in the past, these days my work is entirely computational/data analytical. Please no more advertisements offering to make antibodies.

Starting June 15th, 2017 I will be a resident in Columbus, OH. If you are a patient who wants to see me, you can schedule an appointment at the South High Primary Care Center starting in July.

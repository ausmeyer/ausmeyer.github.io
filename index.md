During 2017-2021, I will a resident physician in the combined program in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics at the Ohio State University and Nationwide Children's Hospital. 
<br>
My graduate and post doctoral research focused on understanding and predicting the evolution of viral proteins, on protein molecular evolution, and on protein structural biology. Broadly, I am interested in infectious diseases; I enjoy the process of applying mathematical modeling and statistical learning to diverse problems. In particular, I am interested in using diverse data sources to understand infectious diseases and how they interact with populations.
<br>
I also love learning and teaching biostatistics and data science. I like finding places where existing data or methods can be applied to ambiguous clinical reasoning. I also like exploring data visualization, using new presentation tools, and developing web applications to make information more useful to non-experts.
<br>
Although I was an experimental biologist in the past, these days my work is entirely computational/data analytical. Please no more advertisements offering to make antibodies.

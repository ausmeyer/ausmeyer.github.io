I am computational biologist and fourth year medical student. My graduate and post doctoral research focused on understanding and predicting the evolution of viral proteins and on protein molecular evolution. I am interested in identifying and quantifying the forces that drive the evolution of viruses and how that plays out in the human population. That extends more generally to infectious disease epidemiology and modeling infectious epidemics. As one might expect, I also enjoy developing new and ever more explantory scientific visulizations using new software tools. Recently, after realizing that the vast majority of clinical studies are only moderately useful for medical reasoning, I developed a more general interest in clinical biostatistics. These days I do entirely computational work.

For my master's research, I crystallized and solved the structure of C2 domains in synaptotagmin with calcium in the binding pocket. For my doctoral research, I implemented molecular evolutionary models of protein evolution and used them to show that simple protein geometry is a major determinant of influenza virus evolution. As a postdoctoral fellow, I focused on identifying constraints that will predict further evolution of the influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. I also do some work to understand how protein energetics can be used to simulate the evolutionary dynamics of proteins, and occasionally (with little success) try to predict specific adaptive mutations.

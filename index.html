  I am computational biologist and medical student. My research focuses primarily on understanding and predicting the evolution of viral proteins and on protein molecular evolution in general. Specifically, I am interested in identifying and quantifying the forces driving the evolution of viruses and how that plays out in the human population. In addition, I am interested in finding ways to predict the molecular evolution and population dynamics of viruses. These days I do entirely computational work.
  
  For my master's research, I crystallized and solved the structure of C2 domains in synaptotagmin with calcium in the binding pocket. For my doctoral research, I implemented molecular evolutionary models of protein evolution and used them to show that simple protein geometry is a major determinant of influenza virus evolution. As a postdoctoral fellow, I focused on identifying constraints that will predict further evolution of the influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. I also do some work to understand how protein energetics can be used to simulate the evolutionary dynamics of proteins, and occasionally (with little success) try to predict specific adaptive mutations.<br>
